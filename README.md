Uploading some macros from our learning experiences with Keyboard Maestro.

Thanks to Jason Dasent for introducing us to this software.  This is a bit of an experimental repo for the time being, so there won't be much instructions!

Our first macro provides a shortcut to changing the VoiceOver output back to the system default at the end of a Zoom call.
